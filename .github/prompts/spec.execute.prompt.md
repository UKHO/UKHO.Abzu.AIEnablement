Where appropriate use a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, writing tests before implementing the feature.

Rules:
- Implement one step at a time
- Prompt for clarification if needed
- Ensure code follows the rules and specification
- Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling
- Include ALL necessary imports and dependencies
- Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling
- Build the code regularly to ensure it compiles and runs correctly

End with "Step X Complete. Here's what I did and why: " followed by an explanation of what you did.
