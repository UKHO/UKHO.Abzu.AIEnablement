# UKHO.Abzu.AIEnablement

## Overview
This repository is a central hub for our work with **AI-assisted development**.  
It contains curated prompts, guidelines, and supporting documentation that help us leverage tools such as **GitHub Copilot** and emerging AI agents effectively in our coding practices.

The goal is to:
- Improve productivity by using high-quality prompts.
- Standardize approaches for AI-assisted development across the team.
- Share learnings, patterns, and practices that scale with future AI tooling.
- Provide a reference point for experimenting with agent-driven coding workflows.
